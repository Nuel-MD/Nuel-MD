Hey there! I’m **Emmanuel**, a full-stack beast crafting web & mobile apps faster than you can say `"console.log('404')"`!  
I sling **React**, **Node.js**, and **TypeScript** like a pro, sprinkle in some **AWS** magic, and ship with **zero downtime**.  
Currently learning **Kubernetes** and grinding toward that sweet certification badge 🏅🐳

If you're building something epic, I’m your dev! 💥
